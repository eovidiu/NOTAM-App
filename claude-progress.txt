## Session 3: FIR Search and NOTAM Filtering
Date: 2026-01-08
Agent: Coding Agent
Status: Complete

### Completed:
- [x] Added searchable ICAO code database (ats_units.json with 107 official FIRs)
- [x] Created ATSUnit model and ATSUnitService for search
- [x] Updated AddFIRView with search-first UI for adding FIRs
- [x] Added active/inactive NOTAM filter to list view

### Feature Details:
**FIR Search:**
- Official FIR database with ICAO codes, names, and countries
- Relevance-based search (exact match > prefix > contains)
- Manual entry fallback for codes not in database

**NOTAM Filter:**
- Default: show only active NOTAMs (current date within effective period)
- Filter menu in top toolbar with counts
- "Active Only (N)" and "All NOTAMs (N)" options
- Shows count of expired/future NOTAMs
- Filter icon changes state to indicate active filtering

### Files Modified:
- NOTAMApp/Models/ATSUnit.swift (new)
- NOTAMApp/Services/ATSUnitService.swift (new)
- NOTAMApp/Resources/ats_units.json (new)
- NOTAMApp/Views/Settings/AddFIRView.swift (updated)
- NOTAMApp/Views/NOTAM/NOTAMListView.swift (updated)

### Git Commits:
- 6e66f25: Add active/inactive NOTAM filter to list view

## Session 4: NOTAM Severity Indicator
Date: 2026-01-08
Agent: Coding Agent
Status: Complete

### Completed:
- [x] Researched NOTAM format for airspace closures (Q-codes, real examples)
- [x] Added NOTAMSeverity enum (critical/warning/caution/info)
- [x] Implemented severity detection logic based on text patterns
- [x] Updated NOTAMRowView with severity badge (icon + colored label)
- [x] Updated NOTAMDetailView with severity banner and enhanced status card
- [x] Added ATS and UIR abbreviations to translator

### Feature Details:
**Severity Levels:**
- Critical (red): FIR/airspace prohibited, "ATS NOT PROVIDED", complete closures
- Warning (orange): Airport/runway closed, restricted areas active
- Caution (yellow): TFR, partial closures, general restrictions
- Info (green): Normal NOTAMs

**Detection Patterns:**
- CRITICAL: "ATS IS NOT PROVIDED", "PROHIBITED" + FIR/UIR/AIRSPACE, "CLSD" + "ALL FLIGHTS"
- WARNING: "AD CLSD", "RWY" + "CLSD", "RESTRICTED AREA" + "ACT"
- CAUTION: "TFR", "CLSD", "RESTRICTED"
- INFO: Default fallback

### Files Modified:
- NOTAMApp/Models/NOTAM.swift (added enum + severity property)
- NOTAMApp/Services/NOTAMTranslator.swift (added ATS, UIR abbreviations)
- NOTAMApp/Views/NOTAM/NOTAMRowView.swift (severity badge)
- NOTAMApp/Views/NOTAM/NOTAMDetailView.swift (severity banner + status card)
- notes.md (added research documentation)
- task_plan.md (marked complete)

### Git Commits:
- efbdacd: Add NOTAM severity indicator for critical closures

---

## Next Steps

1. Open project in Xcode: `open NOTAMApp/NOTAMApp.xcodeproj`
2. Set your Development Team in project settings
3. Build and run on simulator (iOS 17+)
4. Test manual refresh to verify API connectivity
5. Configure FIRs in Settings
6. Verify background refresh and notifications

### Known Considerations:
- FAA API may require specific request format - test and adjust if needed
- Background task timing controlled by iOS system
- Notification permission must be granted by user
