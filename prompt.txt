This was the initial prompt for creating the app:

#start prompt
I want to build an iOS app that will query and display NOTAM using https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/nsapp.html#/ , for a configured list of FIR.
- Feature 1 : The application should allow configuring FIR points . Default FIR LROP.
- Feature 2 : Schedule query fo the end point each hour, each 6 hours, each 12 hours .
- Feature 3 : If there are updates compared to the last query, display a notification on user's phone.
- Feature 4 : Display the orignal NOTAM, and in a separate tab or section display the message in common english
- Feature 5 : Nice and modern swift native UI, use Nano-banana to get suggestions on the interface

Tech stack:
- Swift/SwiftUI
- Everything Apple native
